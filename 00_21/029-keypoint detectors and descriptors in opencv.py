"""What are features, detectors, and keypoints?
Features in an image are unique regions that the computer can easily tell apart.
Corners are good examples of features. Finding these unique features is called feature detection.
Once features are detected we need to find similar ones in a different image.
This means we need to describe the features. 
Once you have the features and its description, you can find same features 
in all images and align them, stitch them or do whatever you want.

Harris corner detector is a good example of feature detector. 

Keypoints are the same thing as points of interest. 
They are spatial locations, or points in the image that define what is interesting or what stand out in the image.
The reason why keypoints are special is because no matter how the image changes...
whether the image rotates, shrinks/expands, is translated, or distorted
you should be able to find the same keypoints in this modified image when comparing with the original image.

Harris corner detector detects corners. 
FAST: Features from Accelerated Segment Test - also detects corners


Each keypoint that you detect has an associated descriptor that accompanies it.
SIFT, SURF and ORB all detect and describe the keypoints.

Descriptors are primarily concerned with both the scale and the orientation of the keypoint.

e.g. run ORB and draw keypoints with rich keypoints.
some of these points have a different circle radius. These deal with scale.

The larger the "circle", the larger the scale was that the point was detected at.
Also, there is a line that radiates from the centre of the circle to the edge. 
This is the orientation of the keypoint, which we will cover next

Usually when we want to detect keypoints, we just take a look at the locations. 
However, if you want to match keypoints between images, 
then you definitely need the scale and the orientation to facilitate this.
