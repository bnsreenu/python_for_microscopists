"""
Application that predicts heart disease percentage in the population of a town
based on the number of bikers and smokers. 

Trained on the data set of percentage of people biking 
to work each day, the percentage of people smoking, and the percentage of 
people with heart disease in an imaginary sample of 500 towns.

#When the Python interpreter reads a source file, it first defines a few special variables. 
#For now, we care about the __name__ variable.
#If we execute our code in the main program, like in our case here, it assigns
# __main__ as the name (__name__). 
#So if we want to run our code right here, we can check if __name__ == __main__
#if so, execute it here. 
#If we import this file (module) to another file then __name__ == app (which is the name of this python file).
